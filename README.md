- Turtle module (comes built-in with Python)

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where you have saved the files.
5. Run the Python script `angry_prash.py` using the following command:

   ```bash
   python angry_prash.py

Project Structure
angry_prash_logo.py: Python script containing the code to draw the logo.
How it Works
We'll use the Turtle module in Python to draw the Angry Prash YouTube logo step by step. The Turtle module allows us to create shapes and drawings by controlling a turtle cursor on a screen.

We'll start by importing the Turtle module and setting up the drawing environment. Then, we'll define functions to draw different parts of the logo, such as the head, eyes, and mouth. Finally, we'll put everything together to create the complete logo.

Credits
This project is inspired by the Angry Prash YouTube channel. The logo is a simplified version of the actual YouTube logo with Angry Prash's face on it.
